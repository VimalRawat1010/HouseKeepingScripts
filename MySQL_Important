###Migrate a MySQL Database Between Two Servers 
##Step One—Perform a MySQL Dump
# Before transferring the database file to the new Server, we first need to back it up on the original virtual server
# by using the mysqldump command.

mysqldump -u root -p --opt database_name > database_name.sql

#  After the dump is performed, you are ready to transfer the database.

## Step Two—Copy the Database
#  SCP helps you copy the database. If you used the previous command, you exported your database to your home folder.

scp database_name.sql username@servername:path/to/database/

#After you connect, the database will be transferred to the new virtual private server.

## Step Three—Import the Database
#  Once the data has been transferred to the new server, you can import the database into MySQL:

mysql -u root -p newdatabase < /path/to/newdatabase.sql

# With that, your transfer via SCP will be complete
